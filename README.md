What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

What is Bitcoin Core Squared?
-----------------------------

Bitcoin Core Squared is the name of open source software which enables the use of Bitcoin Core.
It is designed to facilite a hard fork to increase Bitcoin's block size limit.

Bitcoin Core Squared is a fork of the [Bitcoin Clashic Project](http://bitcoinclashic.org),
which itself is a fork of the [Bitcoin ABC Project](https://bitcoinabc.org),
which itself is yet another fork of the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) software project
(not to be confused between Bitcoin Core client for the Bitcoin project and Bitcoin Core Squared
client for the Bitcoin Core project).
